In this case, the uncertainty for the 5th parameter entry will not get reduced, i.e., at least one eigenvalue will remain unchanged when updating the prior. Since the prior was chosen iid., the maximum eigenvalue of the posterior is then the same as the prior. The E-OED utility function will remain constant until the combination of speed and radius is able to detect all forcing functions.
